# SaskInvents Hand Rehabilitation Project
[SaskInvent][1] is a biomedical engineering student group located at the University of Saskatchewan.
We are dedicated to designing and building medical projects to help people in the community.

## Project Outline
The Hand Rehabilitation Glove is a device that assists stretching of hand tendons back to normal length. 
The glove targets patients who have suffered tendon injuries in their forearms and hands. 
Surgery to reattach and repair these tendons often leaves them shorter than their normal length, and consequently, 
a patient’s hand is restricted to an open position. Even if there is minimal damage to the muscles, the now shorter
and tighter tendons make the closing of a hand often impossible without assistance. The glove is aimed to assist in 
closing a person’s hand by providing measurable, slow pressure on the backs of fingers using inflatable silicone tubes 
to assist the recovery of tendon length and functional independence.
